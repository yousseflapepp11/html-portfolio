<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there!  I'm Youssef, a front-end engineer based in Egypt, who loves to code and build products with a delightful user experience.</p>

<p>I love working in between product, engineering, and developer experience.
   Some things that make me excited are JavaScript, Open Source, simplicity, automating things, and building meaningful user-centric products.</p>

<p>I was born in Egypt and raised in Kuwait and come from a background of studying Computer Science.</p>
